## Annual weather effects on Black-tern abundance and trends

We designed a model to estimate the effects of annual weather patterns on abundance of Black-terns on BBS surveys, while accounting for medium- and long-term population trends. We used two annual weather covariates: one that represented the local spring moisture using the 3-month (April - June) Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI [@beguer√≠a]); and, a second that represented the North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAOI, [@hurrell1995], accessed through <https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/pna/nao.shtml>) from the previous winter (January - June, on a 1-year lag, 18 - 12 months before the BBS surveys were conducted; following [@davis2023]).

The model was based on the GAMYE models described in [@smith2020] and [@smith2023]. In the GAMYE model, the population trajectory (pattern of annual abundance through time) is modeled as an additive combination of a non-linear smooth (i.e., the GAM component) and year-effects that model the annual fluctuations around the smooth (the YE component). We added a sub-model to estimate the year-effects using two predictors, so that the annual fluctuations in stratum-i and year-t ($\gamma_{i,t}$) were an additive combination of the effect of SPEI ($\beta_{1_i}{\rm SPEI}_{i,t}$), the effect of the NAOI in year t-1 ($\beta_{2_i}{\rm NAOI}_t$), and an additional random variate ($\varepsilon_{i,t}$).

$$\gamma_{i,t}= \beta_{1_i}{\rm SPEI}_{i,t}+\beta_{2_i}{\rm NAOI}_t+\varepsilon_{i,t}$$



## Exploring the spatially varying effects of annual weather

We modeled the stratum-level effect of annual weather as a continuous linear effect that varies in space.
